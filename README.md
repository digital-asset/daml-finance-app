## Money-market-fund branch

This demo shows how a money-market fund can interact with a collateral application.

### Parties 

#### Investors 

These include Hedge Funds, Swaps-dealers, Prime brokers, etc. Anybody who would want to own MMF tokens or wants to be able to send and receive margin calls via a DLT. 

#### Fund Manager 

This is the issuer of the MMF. They are responsible for the administration of the MMF. Most of this administration takes place off-ledger. The on-ledger responsibilities include updating the NAV of the fund, and to pay dividends. 

#### Transfer Agent (TA)

The TA is principally responsible for:
- Brokering the subscription and redemption process for their Investors
- Onboarding and off-boarding Cash
- Disbersing dividends to investors 
- Batching subscriptions and redemptions for the Fund Manager
- Onboarding Investors (e.g. KYC)

#### Cash Rail 

The system or party responsible for onboarding and off-boarding cash. Typically a wire system. 

#### Custodian 

The system or party responsible for maintaining Token definitions and global account balances. 

####  Collateral Clearer 

The system responsible for maintaining bilateral collateral agreements between Investors, and to intervene in case of default.

### Principal Workflows 

#### (MMF) Subscriptions 

This workflow allows investors to request a conversion of their already onboarded USD to MMF tokens at a 1:1 rate. 

1. *Investors* request MMF tokens
2. *TA* reviews and pools those requests
3. *Fund Manager* reviews pooled requests, 
  - Initiates subscriptions off-ledger. Once completed, 
  - Approves pooled requests on ledger.
  - ...atomically, USD is transferred to the *Fund Manager* from the *Investors*, and tokens are created for *Investors*. 

#### (MMF) Redemption 

This workflow allows an investor to cash out their MMF token and convert to on-ledger USD. 

(TODO)

#### (MMF) Dividend Drop 

This workflow allows the manager of a MMF to issue a dividend, to be paid in USD. 

1. *Fund Manager* declares a dividend, e.g. "$0.0245 per token". 
2. Any *Investor* which holds a token of the MMF can claim the dividend, to be paid out in USD. 
3. Claims are automatically converted to a settlement instruction to the *Investor*.
